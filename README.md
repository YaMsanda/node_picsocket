# node_picsocket
A NodeJs project with the following obejctive :
  Creating a webpage where several users can upload pictures and see them display in real time.
  They also have to be able to delete a picture and upload multiple pictures in one go.

I used express, socket.io and jquery for the most part.

All development is made in 'dev' branch and clean builds merged into 'master'.
